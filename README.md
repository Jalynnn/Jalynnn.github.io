Heads up! I originally started designing and adding content to my website in this other repo: https://github.com/Jalynnn/Website.

However, I learned the importance of using React as it has allowed for flexibility in my code when it comes to viewing websites on a variety of screen sizes. With motiviation and YouTube videos I was able to complete this website, and I wanted to support future developers. Below are the steps I took and resources to complete a website like mine.

## Set up React with GH Pages

importance of repo name

I use GitHub desktop and VS Code

## Import content

using "npm start" to automatically view the updates locally

## Deploying GH Website

Settings - GH Pages

Note that you do not modify or add to GH pages. Make your changes in main/master. From your main run "npm build x"

Running this anytime will apply your changes to the public page
